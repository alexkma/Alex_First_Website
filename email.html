I remember when I was in grade school, my parents had signed me up for basketball at the local YMCA, but I was too obsessed with computer games to do anything else. This same passion gave me a direction and an idea of what I wanted to major in college. Even though I did not know a thing about Computer Science or programming, the decision at the time just made sense. I am glad I stuck with it.

During college, I obtained a great amount of knowledge, technical and social, thanks to many group projects where I had to deal with multiple, different personalities. I took two semesters of database courses that taught me about relational databases, database design, dimensional modeling, and etc. I was exposed to languages such as Java and C, and I am still constantly learning and improving daily now that I am out of school. Since graduation, I have been working on a side project based on the FIFA World Cup that took place during the summer of 2014 to sharpen up my skills; a database application that keeps track of statistics such as win count, loss count, point differential of every team and game that takes place in the group stage. In the meantime, I have registered for a Hadoop course at the UCSC extension that starts on January 13th to build on my knowledge.

I am currently seeking a full time entry-level position that fits my skill sets. I am proficient in Java and MySQL. I am a quick learner, and I am not afraid to try something out of my comfort zone.
